# 0477_frontend

This is a simple access control project I made for a private party I organized with some friends, developed in one afternoon as my first attempt at React Native. The code isn't perfect, but it gets the job done: managing entry tickets.

## Features

- Basic ticket management.
- Minimalist user interface.
- First project made with React Native.
